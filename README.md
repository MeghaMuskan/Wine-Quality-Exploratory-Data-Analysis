# Wine-Quality-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Wine Quality dataset to understand the factors affecting wine quality and identify key patterns in the data.

# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis (EDA Project)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality dataset to understand the factors that influence wine quality and identify patterns in chemical properties affecting ratings.

## 📌 Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between physicochemical properties of wine and its quality score.
The project focuses on identifying key features that impact wine quality through statistical analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains various chemical attributes of wine samples such as:

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol
* Quality (target variable)

Each row represents a wine sample with a quality rating.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Checking missing values and data types
* Statistical summary of features
* Distribution analysis of wine quality
* Correlation analysis between features
* Visualization using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps

## 📈 Key Insights

* Alcohol content and sulphates showed strong positive correlation with wine quality.
* Higher volatile acidity negatively affected wine quality.
* Most wine samples were rated in the medium quality range.
* Certain chemical properties significantly influence wine ratings.

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Build machine learning models to predict wine quality
* Apply feature selection techniques
* Compare multiple classification algorithms
* Deploy prediction model using Streamlit
